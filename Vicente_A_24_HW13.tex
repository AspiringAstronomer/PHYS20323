\noindent {\bf 1: An electron is found to be in the spin state (in the z-basis):\\
(a) (5 points) Determine the possible values of A such as that the state is normalized.\\
(b) (5 points) Find the expectation values of the operators,\textcolor{color}{text} \langle S_x \rangle \),  \( \langle S_y \rangle \), \( \langle S_z \rangle \), and \( \langle \vec{S}^2 \rangle \).
\[
\chi = A \begin{pmatrix} 3i \\ 4 \end{pmatrix}
\]

\noindent \textbf{The Matrix representation in the z-basis for the components of electron spin operators are given by:} \\
\[
S_x = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
S_y = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -i \\ i & 0 \end{pmatrix}, \quad
S_z = \frac{\hbar}{2} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
\]
\noindent {\bf 2. The average electrostatic field in the earthâ€™s atmosphere in fair weather is approximately given:}
\[
\mathbf{E} = E_0 \left( A e^{-\alpha z} + B e^{-\beta z} \right) \hat{z}
\]
Where A, B, $\alpha$, $\beta$ are positive constants and z is the height above the (locally flat) earth surface.\\
(a) (5 points) Find the average charge density in the atmosphere as a function of height\\
(b) (5 points) Find the electric potential as a function height above the earth\\

\noindent{\bf 3. The following questions refer to stars in the Table below.\\
Note: There may be multiple answers.\\
